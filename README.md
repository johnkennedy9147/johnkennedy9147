### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm John Kennedy.

I'm a software engineer living near Glasgow, Scotland.
I'm mostly work on full stack web including mobile development.
In the past I have worked mainly in large banks and other financial institutions but recently moved into the startup world at a Scottish healthtech company called Phlo.

I am always learning, just now my main focus is getting better at Python and learning Go.
